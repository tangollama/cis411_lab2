## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?    
  Ans: With a containerized version, developers do not need to rely on a single machine for development and presentation. 
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
  Ans: Involving a CI enables developers to more actively monitor their project. CI offers a more visually pleasing version control. In     addition, CI is able to communicate whether and update is working within the site or not, thus providing feedback to the developer at a   faster rate.
