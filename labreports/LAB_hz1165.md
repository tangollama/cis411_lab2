## Questions
**1.Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?**

A containerized version of an application would eliminate the chance of having errors when multiple people are using machines with different configs working on the same project.


**2.If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?**

CI solutiou like CircleCI would test to see if the build will be successful or not before actually deploying the project.
