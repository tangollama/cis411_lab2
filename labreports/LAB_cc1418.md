## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
* An application in a container will run the same anywhere. When working on a team, if everything is working within a container on their machine, they don't have to worry about differences in their local environments when performing merges or comparing work. <br/>
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
* A CI solution runs tests on your code and checks that it works. Just because your application is running on your local machine doesn't mean that it will run everywhere. CI solutions help mitigate this issue without the developer needing to think of every posible test to run against their code. <br/>
