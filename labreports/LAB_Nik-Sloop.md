I was unable to get the app up and running, the command $git push heroku master would not work and I wasnt able to figure out why. 
This is the error, "failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/cis411lab2-nik-sloop.git'"

## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
  It would be benificial because it makes the application more easily able to be deployed. It also alows you to have muiltiple versions
  of the application running. You can have a developing enviornment and a test enviorment.
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
  It allows you to constanly monitor the builds and make sure each build works. It also allows for continuous deployment.
