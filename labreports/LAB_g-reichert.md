## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?

Container technology is a method to package an application so it can be run, with its dependencies, isolated from other processes. The great part about container technology is that we can ship it around with out being concerened that it will break in a new environemnt, since we are just moving the container from place to place. The benefit is that by making a containerized version of the application, we will know that it will run wherever we move it to, and we don't need to be concerened about it breaking when we move it.

2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?

A continuous intergration tool allows us to test to make sure that everything is working when we check in. While we can publish straight to Heroku, that doesn't check to make sure that our code is still working as expected.
