## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?

-I want to ensure that my local environment is identical to those of the developers I work with to avoid a scenario where the code works for some people and not for others due to inconsistent environments. 

2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?

-CircleCI performs tests that allow us to validate the code before it is pushed. It acts as an automatic gatekeeper that will turn away commits that cause errors or fail tests. This way, we can guarantee that our new commits never break older functionality.
