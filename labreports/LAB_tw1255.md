## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
-I think it allows for developers to reach a larger amount of people when it comes to releasing it and it will allow for easier testing.

2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
-CircleCi allows for a continuation of developing. You are constantly getting updates and it benefits you with improving the speed at which things process.
