## Answered Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?

- It would be beneficial because you can use other tools like CircleCI on it. Also you can conceptualize a containerized application more easily than in this context than using localhost

2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?

- CircleCI provides the ability to receive updates on the build of your project via email without you having to monitor it directly. This allows you to see status updates on your code more easily
