## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
## Answer 1
    The benefits of a containerized version of an application are compatibility and portability between different platforms and clouds, higher speed in delivery of enhancements and application start-up, and better security.

1. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
## Answer 2
    The benefit that it provides is debugging, when working on this lab, CircleCI helped me debugg the errors I had made and made sure to depoly only if everything was sucessful.
