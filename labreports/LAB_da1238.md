## Questions

Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?

- This enables developers to reach a larger target audience when it comes to deployment and hence enhancing the experiences of the development cycle in several aspects such as testing.

If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?

- CircleCi allows developers to keep an eye on the state of the application in a manner in which allows for continious re-evaluation. From what I understand, it pretty much allows for extreme programming in a simpler manner.
