## Answers
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
    - Containerization allows us to run an application without launching a vertual machine. This helps increase portability, and allows for easier and faster deployment. This also improves scalability because of the ability to scale indevidual componants of an application, VS having to scale the whole application.
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
    - CircleCI runs automated tests. While Heroku does offer a contanerized platform for development, all tests done will have to be manual. CircleCI allows developers to write automated tests that will be executed every time a code change occures. In other words, CircleCI allows for continuous integration.

## Notes
I'm stating this here, as well as a comment on Canvas. There are commits in my directory where you will see Nathan's handle [nathanczh](https://github.com/nathanczh). This is because I completed most of this lab on his personal computer. Intead of using the work around or buying the pro tools Nathan offered to let me use his Mac. I am simply stating this to assure you that the work is mine and it was all done in my directory, but in order to do the project from Nathan's computer he was added as a colaborator to the project. This is why his name is on some of the commits.
