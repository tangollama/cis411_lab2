## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?

Being able to use the application without spinning it up first is good. Instead of going into a command-line and using npm start and then going to localhost:4000/graphql, you can just use the web url to use the same application. 

2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?

It helps to check if problems are occuring or not. When you are building an application with many different developers pushing to the same repository, it can become cluttered for what is actually working and what is not. Being able to have an application automate that process is very beneficial to have, instead of manually trying to find which commit-push combo broke the application.
