## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
A containerized version of an application would be beneficial because everything is located in one specific designated place and would therefore be much easier to debug and trouble shoot when the need arises.  Then when it finally is running as it should it can be deployed so that it does not hinder anything not within the app itself. 
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
A CI solution like CircleCI is helpful because it tells you when a build fails, why the build fails and this makes it much easier to find and fix problems within your application.
