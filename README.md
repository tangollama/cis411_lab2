# CIS 411 Lab 4: Continuous Deployment
This is the Continuous Deployment (CD) Lab for CIS 411: Systems Analysis and Design for [Messiah University](http://messiah.edu)

The purpose of this lab is to get hands on experience working with Docker, CircleCI, and a Cloud Service Provider like Heroku to create a CI/CD pipeline. Though the lab is generally paint by numbers, the hands on experience with the tools is meant to prepare students to improvise on this relatively simple implementation as teams approach CIS 471/472.  

# Doing the Lab

## 1. Pre-Requisites
1. GitHub account
2. Git is installed on your development machine.
3. Text editor or other integrated development environment (IDE) for modifying code.  
4. You will install Docker (and need an account on Docker Hub) as part of this lab.
5. You will install Heroku CLI (and setup a student account with credits) as part of this lab.  (Other Cloud Platforms are allowed)

## 2. Lab Description
This lab will build upon your prior experience using CircleCI in [lab 1](https://github.com/trevordbunch/cis411_lab1_CI) for the first two steps.  Step 3 will packaging the GraphQL application into a Docker container.  Step 4 will focus on setting up the Heroku (or other Cloud Platform) deployment location, and Step 5 will guide you through setting up the CI/CD pipeline in CircleCI.  After the lab, you will need to respond to 4 questions about why container technology is useful in modern architectures.

Here are the Detailed instructions for executing this lab using: 
- [Heroku](LAB_INSTRUCTIONS_Heroku.md)
- [Digital Ocean](LAB_INSTRUCTIONS_DigitalOcean.md)  
- [Amazon Web Services](LAB_INSTRUCTIONS_AWS.md)

You are expected to compile your findings into a lab report following this [template](labreports/LAB_TEMPLATE.md).

You are welcome to complete this lab using any Cloud Provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.).  If you choose this path - then I encourage you to consider the extra credit opportunity below.

## 3. Submissions
You are expected to create a lab report as a markdown file under the `labreports` directory using the **LAB_[GITHUB Handle].md** naming convention in your forked repository.  After you have reviewed your work, then you should submit a `Pull Request` to this repository with your lab report and any accompanying images/files (e.g., required diagrams).  Add the `Pull Request` URL into the course room LMS (Canvas) for grading.

# Extra Credit

- +50 points - Complete the Lab Instructions for Google Cloud Platform [Draft Instructions](LAB_INSTRUCTIONS_Google.md)
- +100 points - Be the first (measured by successful PR) to add Lab Instructions for another Cloud Platform.

## 4. Grading Guidelines
The following elements have been incorporated into your assignment rubric.
1. **Working CI/CD Pipeline:** There is a screenshot from CircleCI that shows both successful workflow steps.
2. **Working App:** In addition to any screenshots, anyone can go to the deployed app URL and add an account.
3. **Question Responses:** There are four questions at the end of the lab about container technology.  They are assessed for accuracy and completeness.  Distinguished (Full Marks) scores are reserved for responses that cite their sources.
4. **Communication:**  The markdown file is written according to professional standards by choosing the appropriate markdown elements, links and embedded content.
